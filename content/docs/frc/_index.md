## What is Our FRC Team?

Our team, #9777, is our FRC team based off our [FTC]({{<ref "docs/ftc/">}}) team #8081 and our sister FTC team Carbo-Knights (team #19728).

This team was founded in 2024.

## What Is on This Website?

This website is supposed to be a goldmine of knowledge for our team, as well as other teams. 
We will also use this site as a way to keep track of important information and help with team sustainability over time.

## Where Do I Start?

I recommend using this documentation as a reference. There isn't a step-by-step guide on how to get started, but looking at our documentation for swerve and other systems could definitely be helpful.
