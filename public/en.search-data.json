It’s similar to one of those rotating chairs you sit on.\nThe wheels have two parts: the part that orients or aligns the wheel, and the part that makes it spin or go.\nA good example is the front wheel of a car, there is a “motor” that turns the wheel (not really, but using it as an example) to face any heading The other part of the wheel is the drive. The drive is the engine that actually propels the wheel.\n(Yes I know the car geeks will only say that works for 4 wheel drive and that the heading can only go a few degreees, but it’s hard to make a better example)","what-is-swerve#What is swerve?":"What is swerve?Serve drive is a fun one to explain, because it takes a long time to fully understand it, but once you do, you cannot go back."},"title":"Intro"},"/docs/ftc/":{"data":{"":"","what-is-8081#What Is #8081":"Team #8081 is a FTC team from Gilbert, Arizona that functions from Gilbert Christian Schools and aims to provide opportunities to interact with STEM in association with FIRST.\nTeam #8081 is known as the Knights of the Lab Table and was founded in 2013."},"title":"FTC"}}
